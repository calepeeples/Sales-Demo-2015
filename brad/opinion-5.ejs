	<h4>Your records locations</h4>
				Having accurate medical records locations is essential in making sure we're able to provide you the best possible care, we will not be able to proceed without them. Your current insurance provider has given us a list of locations that have access to your medical records. In order for our staff physicians to have a better understanding of your condition, we will need to start calling the locations on this list to gather your physical records. Typically these locations will be clinics, hospitals, or clinical laboratories and may sometimes have abbreviated names or locations.
